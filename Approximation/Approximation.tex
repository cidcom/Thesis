This chapter explores whether an auction format represented by the DMP selling mechanism can be modeled as an asymmetric first-price sealed-bid auction (FPA) with common priors; that is, an auction in which bidders are characterized by different probability distributions sharing a common support. Ideally, if the DMP auction was shown to be a special case of some corresponding common priors auction, then the numerical solution methods presented in Hubbard and Parsch~\cite{HubbardPaarsch2011}, and extensively studied by the economic community, could be employed. Conversely, if the DMP auction format cannot be shown to constitute a special case of the common priors auction, then, provided the expected profits for the bidders in both auction formats differ only slightly, the common priors auction format could still effectively be used to approximate the solution to the DMP auction.

\subsection{Mathematical Description} % (fold)
\label{sub:mathematical_description}

Following the notation of Chapter~\ref{cha:indirect}, let each bidder $i$ be characterized by the utility function
\begin{equation*}
    u_i(b,c) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    b_i-c_i & \;\text{if } b_i < \displaystyle\min_{j\neq i}b_j,\\
    0 & \;\text{if } b_i > \displaystyle\min_{j\neq i}b_j,
  \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
where, as before, $b = (b_1,\ldots,b_n)$, and $c = (c_1,\ldots,c_n)$. In the common priors auction, we assume that each bidder $i$ draws their cost from common support across all bidders; i.e., let
\begin{equation*}
  c_i\in [\underline{c}, \bar{c}] \quad\text{for all } i\in N.
\end{equation*}

Let $F_i$ be the distribution function of $c_i$ for all $i\in N$. Note that the distribution functions between bidders need not be equal, and hence, we are dealing with an asymmetric FPA.

We further assume that
\begin{assumptions}
\label{ass:assumptions_common_priors_approximation}
Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $F_i$ is differentiable over $(\underline{c}, \bar{c}]$ with a derivative $f_i$ locally bound away from zero over this interval;
  \item $F_i$ is atomless; and
  \item $F_i(c)>0$ for all $c\in [\underline{c}, \bar{c}]$ and $i\in N$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{assumptions}
These assumptions correspond to Assumptions~A.1 and Theorem~U.1 in Lebrun~\cite{Lebrun2006}.

With these assumptions at hand, as shown by Lebrun~\cite{Lebrun2006}, there exists one and only one pure-strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium where bidders engage in serious bidding; that is, bid at least their cost. Formally,
\begin{proposition}[Characterization of the Equilibrium in Common Priors Setting]
\label{prop:characterization_of_the_equilibrium_in_common_priors_setting_approximation}
Let Assumptions~\ref{ass:assumptions_common_priors_approximation} be satisfied. There exists one and only one pure-strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium where bidders submit at least their costs. In every such equilibrium, bidder $i\in N$ follows a bid function $b_i$, for all $1\leq i\leq n$ such that its inverse, $c_i$, satisfy the following system of differential equations
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d}{db}c_i(b) = \frac{1 - F_i(c_i(b))}{f_i(c_i(b))}\left[ \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{b-c_k(b)} - \frac{1}{b-c_i(b)} \right]
\end{equation*}
for all $1\leq i\leq n$, with the following lower boundary condition
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:foc_ode_lower_boundary_approximation}
  c_i(\underline{b}) = \underline{c}
\end{equation}
and the upper boundary condition
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:foc_ode_upper_boundary_approximation}
  c_i(\bar{c}) = \bar{c}
\end{equation}
for all $1\leq i\leq n$.
\end{proposition}

In effect, Proposition~\ref{prop:characterization_of_the_equilibrium_in_common_priors_setting_approximation} is a special case of Proposition~\ref{prop:characterization_of_the_equilibrium_indirect}. That is, the equilibrium bidding functions still have to satisfy the system of nonlinear ODEs given by Equation~\eqref{eq:foc_ode_indirect}; however, in this case, the lower boundary condition reduces to
\begin{equation*}
  c_i(\underline{b}) = \underline{c},
\end{equation*}
and the upper boundary condition to
\begin{equation*}
  c_i(\bar{c}) = \bar{c},
\end{equation*}
i.e., the bids never exceed the upper extremity of the common support range.

It should be noted that, even though the bidding problem is considerably simpler than the original one discussed in this thesis, the closed-form solution exists only in a handful of special cases~\cite{Krishna10,HubbardPaarsch2011}.
