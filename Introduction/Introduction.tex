Mobile communications has become an indispensable part of our everyday lives. According to Ofcom~\cite{OfcomReport2013}, 51\% of all adults in the UK own a smartphone, and approximately 24\% of all UK households own a tablet. Furthermore, one in five adults declares they would miss their mobile most if it were taken away. It should be noted that these numbers continue to rise, and with each year the penetration of mobile communications will increase.

Parallel to this, mobile users are given access to a plethora of wireless access technologies: from WiFi, through 3G, to the latest 4G. Cities throughout the UK are now offering free WiFi hotspots \cite{BBCWiFiGlasgow2014}. Furthermore, according to Ofcom~\cite{OfcomLTE2013}, while 3G already covers 98\% of the UK population indoors, this figure is promised to be at least matched by the 4G mobile services by the end of 2017 at the latest. In an environment of such diversity and heterogeneity, where each wireless access technology has its own distinct characteristics, network selection mechanisms provide an efficient way of handling communications services by matching the services' required quality with the characteristics of a particular access technology \cite{HossainBeaubrun09}. The importance of these mechanisms is emphasized by the fact that multimode smartphones (iPhones, Android phones, BlackBerry phones) and tablets (iPads, Android tablets) currently dominate the market thus enabling users to connect to many of the available wireless access technologies.

This diversity opens exciting, new possibilities in both the technological and economic sense. The exclusive one-to-one mapping between network operators and subscribers need no longer hold; when requesting a bearer service, the network selection mechanism will be responsible for selecting the network operator (access technology) that best matches the required quality requirements of the service. From the subscribers' perspective, this permits the ability to seamlessly connect at any time, at any place, and to the technology offering the highest quality available for the best price: a paradigm referred to as \emph{Always Best Connected} \cite{ABC03}. From the network operators' perspective, the integration of wireless access technologies will allow for more efficient usage of network resources, and hence, the most economic way of providing both universal coverage, and broadband access \cite{HossainBeaubrun09}.

However, there also exists the possibility of a `tussle' since there are many different actors with opposing interests involved \cite{Clark02}. For example, it is in the best interest of subscribers to obtain the highest quality of the service for the lowest price. Network operators, on the other hand, aim to maximise their profit by performing efficient load balancing. Furthermore, the situation may become even more complex should the service provision be decoupled from the network operators; that is, if the service provision is handled by a separate entity, service provider, while network operators are left with handling of the transport provision \cite{DMBushTussle09}. Therefore, the problem of network selection, which was considered to be technologically difficult, can also be considered to be the problem of economics where wireless access, traded on a per connection basis, is an electronic good that is sold to the subscribers.
