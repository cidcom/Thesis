The results presented in the previous chapter describe only a single stage of the selection process employed in the Digital Marketplace (DM); i.e., a one-shot DM auction. As such, the temporal (or dynamic) aspect of the process was neglected. The main reason for such a decision was as follows. Concentrating only on a single stage of the process considerably simplified the inherent analytical complexity of the problem and rendered the analysis tractable in the case of two competing bidders. As a result, light was shed on the appropriateness of the DM auction as a network selection mechanism at least in the case of two bidders. In other words, if the results of the analysis of the one-shot DM auction were unfavourable, then that would already render the mechanism inappropriate, and hence, little would be gained from the inclusion of the temporal aspect in the analysis.

On the other hand, it is important to consider the temporal aspect of the selection process since network selection evolves with time. For example, parameters such as reputation of each bidder, number of buyers (and price weights), etc., which were considered static thus far, will change with time since the reputation of each bidder depends on their past (service provision) history, and more than one buyer will enter the marketplace at any one time (and hence, price weights will vary with time).

The conceptual description of the network selection process in the DM is as follows. The end-users post service requests, and the network operators compete over them. The entire exchange is implemented as a procurement first-price sealed-bid (FPA) auction. The auctions operate in real time and transaction volumes and prices reflect the relative status of demand and supply. In order to simplify the modelling, it is assumed that the probability of two auctions occurring at the same instance of time is zero. Therefore, the network operators cannot bid at two auctions simultaneously.

Describe the model here. Start with the conceptual description, then move on to more rigorous, mathematical description. Link to paper by Figliozzi on Transportation Marketplaces~\cite{FigliozziJaillet2008}.

Perhaps, any remaining sections will tackle different (simplifying) assumptions: costs drawn only once, etc. Are all assumptions related to different information disclosure cases?
