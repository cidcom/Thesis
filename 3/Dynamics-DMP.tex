The results presented in the previous chapter describe only a single stage (i.e., a one-shot auction) of the selection process employed in the Digital Marketplace (DM). As such, the temporal (or dynamic) aspect of the process has so far been neglected. Not only did this allow for a simplified and tractable analytical analysis of the DM auction, but also it shed some light into the appropriateness of the DM auction as a network selection mechanism. In other words, if the results of a one-shot auction were unfavourable, then that would already render the mechanism inappropriate, and hence, little would be gained from the inclusion of the temporal aspect in the analysis.
