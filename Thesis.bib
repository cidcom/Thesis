	Abstract = {Internet auctions have recently gained widespread popularity and are one of the most successful forms of electronic commerce. We examine a unique dataset of eBay coin auctions to explore the determinants of bidder and seller behavior. We first document a number of empirical regularities. We then specify and estimate a structural econometric model of bidding on eBay. Using our parameter estimates from this model, we measure the extent of the winner's curse and simulate seller revenue under different reserve prices.},

	Abstract = { Maskin and Riley (2003) and Lebrun (2006) prove that the Bayes-Nash equilibrium of first-price auctions is unique. This uniqueness requires the assumption that a buyer never bids above his value. We demonstrate that, in asymmetric first-price auctions (with or without a minimum bid), the relaxation of this assumption results in additional equilibria that are \&quot;substantial.\&quot; Although in each of these additional equilibria no buyer wins with a bids above his value, the allocation of the object and the selling price may vary among the equilibria. Furthermore, we show that such phenomena can only occur under asymmetry in the distributions of values.},

A methodology is provided for deriving conditions that are necessary and sufficient to determine when two simple trading environments maximize either social or private surplus.

Often, the optimal mechanism is simply to order potential suppliers and to tender take-it-or-leave-it offers to each sequentially. We completely characterize the environments in which either mechanism is optimal. In doing so, we develop a general methodology that determines when and if a given trading institution is optimal.},

@article{Hansen88,
	Abstract = { This article studies auctions in which several sellers compete for the right to sell to a market characterized by a negatively sloped demand curve. In this environment the quantity traded becomes endogenous; this effect leads to three results concerning the outcomes of open versus (first-price) sealed-bid auctions. First, an open auction yields a higher expected price than does sealed bidding. Second, and more important, the open auction captures less of the potential gains from trade than does the sealed-bid auction. Third, for broad classes of demand curves, the efficiency gains from switching to sealed bids from an open auction accrue to both sellers and the buyer, so that all concerned parties would agree to the change. A direct application of the theory is to procurement; the heavy use of sealed bidding in procurement is seen as rational in light of these results. Auction models with endogenous quantity could be an alternative to price-setting oligopoly models for the study of price formation in general, for the latter impose strong information requirements on agents and yield only equilibrium price vectors, not equilibrium processes for determining prices.},

	Abstract = {We consider an organisation which has been allotted a fixed budget [`]A' by higher authorities, for procuring certain specified items. It seeks price quotations from firms. The firm quoting the lowest price secures the contract to sell the item to the organisation. In this context we compare first price and second price auctions and derive the following results. (i) The expected price in the first price auction is lower than the expected price in the second price auction. (ii) The expected quantity sold is the same across the two auctions. (iii) With a rise in the number of firms the expected price goes down and the expected quantity sold goes up in both FPA and SPA. (iv) The expected profit to any firm in equilibrium is also the same across the two auctions. (v) We analyse the effect of reserve prices and discuss optimal reserve price. (vi) We also discuss quantity auctions and show that they are equivalent to standard benchmark auctions.},
