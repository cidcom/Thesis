This work would not have been possible if not for the support and intellectual input of many great individuals.

First and foremost, I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my supervisor, Dr.~Robert Atkinson, for his great advice and support when I needed it most. A very special thanks go also to Dr.~Alex Dickson for sharing his passion and expertise of economics and game theory.

Last but not least, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my family for their constant support and endless encouragement, and to my friends Nadezhda Shivarova, Dr.~Neil Sinclair, Daniel Harkin, Xavier Bellekens, Dare Owatemi and Dr.~Alisdair McDiarmid for their help, lengthy discussions, and belief that I could accomplish that much.
